        "Project Summary: The project begins by implementing forward propagation, which involves the flow of data through the neural network to generate predictions. It focuses on a neural network with a single hidden layer. The input data matrix consists of two samples, with each sample represented by a vector of five features.\n",
        "\n",
        "To enable the neural network to learn from the data, weights and biases are introduced. The weights represent the strength of connections between the input data and the hidden layer neurons. They are organized in a weight matrix, with each row corresponding to the weights associated with a specific neuron in the hidden layer. Biases are adjustable offsets that influence the neuron activations and are represented by a bias matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Forward propagation involves several mathematical operations. The input data matrix is multiplied by the weight matrix, and the biases are added. The resulting matrix captures the weighted sum of inputs for each neuron in the hidden layer. To introduce non-linearity and enable complex modeling, an activation function, such as the sigmoid function, is applied element-wise to the matrix. This step produces the activation values for each neuron, representing their response to the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving beyond forward propagation, the project also explores backward propagation, commonly known as backpropagation. This process enables the neural network to adjust its weights and biases based on the error between the predicted outputs and the true labels. By iteratively updating the weights and biases, the network can improve its predictions over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Backward propagation involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. This is achieved through the application of calculus and the chain rule. The gradients are then used to update the weights and biases in a direction that minimizes the loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement backward propagation, the project combines the principles of calculus, linear algebra, and programming. The gradients are calculated by propagating the error backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases accordingly. The project emphasizes the importance of efficient implementation techniques, such as vectorization, to optimize the computational performance."
